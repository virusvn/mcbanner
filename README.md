mcbanner
========

Linux application for generating Minecraft banners.

Includes
--------

* A web server/page showing the variations of Minecraft banners, as SVG approximations.
* A commandline application for evolving Minecraft banners with GAs
* Go code for rendering SVG as PNG (by using rsvg-convert)

The original goal
-----------------

* Given an image, get the steps for creating the closest looking Minecraft banner. This goal is a work in progress, since the evolution is not rapid enough. Perhaps using smaller images when rendering from SVG, or another algorithm, would work.
